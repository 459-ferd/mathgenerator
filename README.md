# mathgenerator

A math problem generator, created for the purpose of giving self-studying students and teaching organizations the means to easily get access to random math problems to suit their needs.

To try out generators, go to <https://todarith.ml/generate/>

If you have an idea for a generator, please add it as an issue and tag it with the "New Generator" label.

## Installation

The project can be install via pip

```bash
pip install mathgenerator
```

## Basic Usage
Here is an example of how you would generate an addition problem:

```python
from mathgenerator import mathgen

#generate an addition problem
problem, solution = mathgen.addition()

#another way to generate an addition problem using genById()
problem, solution = mathgen.genById(0)
```
### More Complicated Usage

```
import sys
from mathgenerator import mathgen

worksheet = mathgen.make_worksheet("2020-11-29")
mathgen.add_section_with_task_to_worksheet(worksheet, 105, 5)
mathgen.add_section_with_task_to_worksheet(worksheet, 2, 5)
mathgen.write_pdf(worksheet)
```

## Documentation
`getGenList()` returns a list of all generators in the repository in the format `[id, title, self, funcname]`

`genById(id)` generates a problem, solution set with generator id `id` in the form of a list in the format `[problem, solution]`

`make_pdf(id, count)` creates a printable pdf worksheet with `count` problems generated by the generator with id `id`.
